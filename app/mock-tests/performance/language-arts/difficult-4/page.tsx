TO: The School Board
FROM: A Grade 5 Student

PURPOSE
I am proposing that our school establish a food garden on our compound. Based on the information I have studied, this project would benefit students, families, and the wider community.

WHY FOOD SECURITY MATTERS
Jamaica imports a significant portion of its food. When global prices rise or supply chains are disrupted, families struggle to afford or find enough to eat. Growing food locally reduces this dependence and protects communities from these risks.

TWO BENEFITS OF THE GARDEN
First, the garden would provide fresh vegetables such as callaloo, tomatoes, and herbs that could be used in the school canteen. This means students eat more nutritiously and the school spends less on food. Second, students would learn practical farming and science skills. Measuring growth, testing soil, and maintaining plants all link to the curriculum while teaching responsibility.

ONE CHALLENGE AND SOLUTION
One challenge is the cost of seeds, tools, and irrigation. This could be overcome by applying for funding from the Ministry of Agriculture or seeking donations from parents and local businesses. A small investment at the start would create long-term savings for the school.

I believe this project is realistic, valuable, and exactly the kind of community contribution our school should be making.

Respectfully submitted,
A Grade 5 Student</p>

              <p>Food security means having reliable access to enough healthy food to meet people's nutritional needs. Jamaica produces some of its own food, including fruits, vegetables, and sugar cane, but imports a significant percentage of what its population eats, including wheat, rice, and many processed foods.</p>
              <p>Dependence on imported food creates risks. When global food prices rise or supply chains are disrupted — for example, during a pandemic or natural disaster — imported food becomes more expensive or harder to obtain. This can lead to hunger and hardship for families who cannot afford higher prices.</p>
              <p>Growing more food locally could reduce these risks. Farmers who grow traditional Jamaican crops such as yam, cassava, breadfruit, and callaloo contribute to local food supply. School gardens, community plots, and urban farming projects are ways in which communities can increase local food production.</p>
              <p>However, local farming faces challenges including poor soil in some areas, limited access to water, high costs for seeds and tools, and competition from cheaper imported goods. For food security to improve, government support, improved farming technology, and community cooperation are all needed.</p>

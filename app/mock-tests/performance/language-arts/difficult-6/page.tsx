      "Each impact is independent and can be solved separately without considering others",

      "The source fully agrees that only global agreements can protect Jamaica",
      "While global action is essential, the source makes clear that local adaptation protects Jamaican communities, ecosystems, and industries NOW — waiting for global solutions leaves Jamaica vulnerable to impacts already underway",

Scientists have found that human activities — particularly burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas — have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the Earth to warm. Jamaica is especially vulnerable to climate change despite contributing very little to global carbon emissions. Rising sea levels threaten to flood low-lying coastal areas and erode beaches. Stronger and more frequent hurricanes bring greater wind damage and flooding. Longer droughts reduce water availability for farming and drinking. Farmers in Jamaica are already experiencing unpredictable rainfall, with some areas receiving too much rain at once and others experiencing prolonged dry spells. This makes it difficult to grow crops reliably. Some coral reefs, which protect coastlines and support fishermen, are bleaching and dying due to warmer ocean temperatures. Responding to climate change requires both reducing emissions globally and adapting to changes locally. Students can contribute by conserving energy and water, learning about sustainable practices, and advocating for change in their schools and communities.`

                <p className="whitespace-pre-line text-slate-700">Good morning, students, teachers, and guests.

Today I want to talk to you about one of the most urgent challenges of our time: climate change — and what it means for Jamaica.

Climate change happens when human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels, release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This traps heat and causes the planet to warm. Scientists around the world agree that this warming is already changing our weather, raising our sea levels, and threatening our way of life.

Here in Jamaica, the effects are already visible. First, our coastlines are at risk. Rising sea levels are eroding our beaches and threatening to flood low-lying communities that generations of Jamaicans call home. Second, our farmers are struggling. Unpredictable rainfall means crops can fail from drought in one season and flood in the next. Our food security is being undermined by a problem we did not cause.

But here is the most important thing to understand: we are not powerless. There are two things we as students can do right now.

First, we can conserve energy in our schools and homes. Switch off lights when you leave a room. Reduce the use of air conditioning. These small steps, multiplied by millions of people, add up to real change. Second, we can raise our voices. Write to community leaders. Create campaigns. Encourage our school to adopt sustainable practices. Advocacy — using our communication skills to demand change — is one of the most powerful tools we have.

Climate change is urgent. But so is our response. The future of Jamaica is in our hands. Let us act. Thank you.

A Grade 5 Student</p>

              <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. Scientists have found that human activities — particularly burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas — have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing the Earth to warm.</p>
              <p>Jamaica is especially vulnerable to climate change despite contributing very little to global carbon emissions. Rising sea levels threaten to flood low-lying coastal areas and erode beaches. Stronger and more frequent hurricanes bring greater wind damage and flooding. Longer droughts reduce water availability for farming and drinking.</p>
              <p>Farmers in Jamaica are already experiencing unpredictable rainfall, with some areas receiving too much rain at once and others experiencing prolonged dry spells. This makes it difficult to grow crops reliably. Some coral reefs, which protect coastlines and support fishermen, are bleaching and dying due to warmer ocean temperatures.</p>
              <p>Responding to climate change requires both reducing emissions globally and adapting to changes locally. Students can contribute by conserving energy and water, learning about sustainable practices, and advocating for change in their schools and communities.</p>

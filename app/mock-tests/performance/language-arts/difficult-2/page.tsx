  const sourceBodyText = `Coastal erosion is the process by which the sea wears away sand and rock along a coastline. In Jamaica, many beaches have been shrinking over the decades due to natural forces such as waves and storms, as well as human activities like sand mining and careless coastal construction. Beaches are important to Jamaica for several reasons. They attract tourists whose spending supports hotels, restaurants, and thousands of jobs. They also act as natural barriers that protect low-lying land from storm surges and flooding. Without healthy beaches, both livelihoods and lives could be at risk. Scientists and environmental organisations have proposed several solutions. These include planting sea grape and mangrove trees to hold sand in place, enforcing laws against illegal sand mining, and using offshore structures to slow the force of waves. Some communities have also started beach clean-up projects to reduce litter that damages coastal ecosystems. Effective beach protection requires cooperation between the government, businesses, communities, and schools. Students can contribute by learning about coastal ecosystems, raising awareness, and participating in conservation projects. Without action, Jamaica's beaches may continue to shrink.`

                <p className="whitespace-pre-line text-slate-700">Dear Minister of Environment,

I am writing to urge the government to take stronger action to protect Jamaica's beaches before it is too late.

Our beaches are not simply places for swimming. They are vital to our economy and our safety. According to the source, tourist spending at beach destinations supports thousands of jobs in hotels and restaurants. If our beaches disappear, these livelihoods will be at risk. Beaches also act as natural barriers against storm surges and flooding. Losing them puts coastal communities in danger.

Two major threats must be addressed. First, illegal sand mining is actively destroying our beaches by removing the very material that holds them together. Second, poor coastal construction disrupts natural processes and makes erosion worse.

I propose two specific actions. First, the government should strictly enforce existing laws against sand mining, with meaningful penalties for those who break them. Second, funding should be allocated to plant mangrove and sea grape trees along vulnerable coastlines, since these plants hold sand in place naturally and cost-effectively.

Our beaches belong to all Jamaicans. I urge you to act now, before what remains is lost.

Yours respectfully,
A Grade 5 Student</p>

              <p>Coastal erosion is the process by which the sea wears away sand and rock along a coastline. In Jamaica, many beaches have been shrinking over the decades due to natural forces such as waves and storms, as well as human activities like sand mining and careless coastal construction.</p>
              <p>Beaches are important to Jamaica for several reasons. They attract tourists whose spending supports hotels, restaurants, and thousands of jobs. They also act as natural barriers that protect low-lying land from storm surges and flooding. Without healthy beaches, both livelihoods and lives could be at risk.</p>
              <p>Scientists and environmental organisations have proposed several solutions. These include planting sea grape and mangrove trees to hold sand in place, enforcing laws against illegal sand mining, and using offshore structures to slow the force of waves. Some communities have also started beach clean-up projects to reduce litter that damages coastal ecosystems.</p>
              <p>Effective beach protection requires cooperation between the government, businesses, communities, and schools. Students can contribute by learning about coastal ecosystems, raising awareness, and participating in conservation projects. Without action, Jamaica's beaches may continue to shrink.</p>

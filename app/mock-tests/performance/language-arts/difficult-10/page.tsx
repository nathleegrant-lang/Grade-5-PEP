In today's digital world, students encounter information through social media, websites, videos, and messaging apps. Not all of this information is accurate or trustworthy, making media literacy an essential skill for the 21st century. Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is shared, sometimes unknowingly, by people who believe it to be true. Disinformation is false information that is deliberately created and spread to mislead people. Both can have serious consequences — from causing people to make poor health decisions to spreading harmful stereotypes or influencing elections. Students can develop media literacy by questioning the source of information, checking facts using trusted websites, looking for evidence to support claims, and considering whether a message is trying to persuade rather than inform. These critical thinking skills are not only useful online — they apply to all areas of learning and life. Schools have an important role in teaching media literacy. When students learn to evaluate information carefully, they become more responsible digital citizens. They are less likely to share false information and more likely to contribute positively to online and real-world communities.`

A Media Literacy Guide for Grade 3 and 4 Students

Have you ever read something online and wondered: is this really true? If you have, that is a great sign — because asking that question is the first step to being a smart digital citizen.

WHAT IS MEDIA LITERACY?
Media literacy means being able to look at information you see online — on videos, social media, websites, or messages — and decide whether it is accurate and trustworthy. Not everything you read on the internet is true. Some people share information that is wrong by accident. Others share false information on purpose to trick people. Your job is to be smart enough to tell the difference.

WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Imagine reading online that a certain fruit cures all diseases. If you believe this and tell your parents, they might not go to the doctor when they need to. False information can cause real harm. Being media literate protects you, your family, and your community.

THREE STEPS TO CHECK IF SOMETHING IS TRUE

Step 1: Ask — Who said this?
Look for the name of the person or organisation that shared the information. Is it a well-known, trusted source like a government website, a hospital, or a recognised newspaper? If you cannot find out who shared it, be very careful.

Step 2: Check another source.
Look for the same information on two or three other trusted websites. If the same fact appears in many reliable places, it is more likely to be true. If you cannot find it anywhere else, it might be false.

Step 3: Ask an adult.
If you are unsure about something you have read, ask a teacher, parent, or librarian. They can help you check if it is accurate. It is always better to ask than to share something that turns out to be wrong.

Remember: being a smart digital citizen means thinking before you click, like, or share. Stay curious, stay critical, and stay safe online!

              <p>Media literacy is the ability to access, analyse, evaluate, and create media in different forms. In today's digital world, students encounter information through social media, websites, videos, and messaging apps. Not all of this information is accurate or trustworthy, making media literacy an essential skill for the 21st century.</p>
              <p>Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is shared, sometimes unknowingly, by people who believe it to be true. Disinformation is false information that is deliberately created and spread to mislead people. Both can have serious consequences — from causing people to make poor health decisions to spreading harmful stereotypes or influencing elections.</p>
              <p>Students can develop media literacy by questioning the source of information, checking facts using trusted websites, looking for evidence to support claims, and considering whether a message is trying to persuade rather than inform. These critical thinking skills are not only useful online — they apply to all areas of learning and life.</p>
              <p>Schools have an important role in teaching media literacy. When students learn to evaluate information carefully, they become more responsible digital citizens. They are less likely to share false information and more likely to contribute positively to online and real-world communities.</p>

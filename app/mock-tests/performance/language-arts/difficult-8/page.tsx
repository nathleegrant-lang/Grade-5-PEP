In Jamaica, public health challenges include high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which are linked to poor diet, physical inactivity, and lifestyle choices. NCDs are responsible for a large proportion of deaths and hospitalisations in Jamaica. Unlike infectious diseases, NCDs are not passed from person to person. They develop over time, often as a result of habits formed from childhood. This means that promoting healthy habits among young people is one of the most effective strategies for reducing NCDs in the future. Access to healthcare is not equal across Jamaica. Rural communities and lower-income populations may have limited access to doctors, nurses, and health facilities. This means some people only seek help when they are already seriously ill, making treatment harder and more expensive. Schools can play a powerful role in public health by promoting physical activity, teaching nutrition, providing clean water and sanitation, and creating environments where students feel safe and supported. When schools partner with health organisations, the impact on communities can be significant and long-lasting.`

TO: The Principal
FROM: A Grade 5 Student

INTRODUCTION
I am writing to propose the creation of a School Health Programme. Public health is one of the most pressing issues in Jamaica today. Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are responsible for a large proportion of deaths in our country, and many of these conditions are linked to habits formed during childhood. Our school has a unique opportunity — and responsibility — to help.

WHY PUBLIC HEALTH MATTERS
According to what I have studied, NCDs develop over time as a result of poor diet, inactivity, and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Schools that promote healthy habits can have a long-lasting impact on students' health and on the health of our wider community.

INITIATIVE 1: WEEKLY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NUTRITION LESSONS
I propose that every class participate in a minimum of two structured physical activity sessions per week, combined with a monthly lesson on nutrition. Students who understand which foods nourish their bodies and who develop the habit of regular exercise are less likely to develop NCDs as adults. This initiative is low-cost and can be led by existing teachers with some professional development support.

INITIATIVE 2: SCHOOL-HEALTH CENTRE PARTNERSHIP
I recommend that our school partner with the nearest health centre to provide termly health checks for students. Trained nurses could visit the school to measure weight, check eyesight, and screen for common conditions. Catching problems early leads to better outcomes and teaches students the importance of regular check-ups.

Together, these two initiatives would make our school a centre for healthy living — benefiting not just students, but families and our whole community.

Respectfully submitted,
A Grade 5 Student</p>

              <p>Public health refers to the efforts taken by governments, organisations, and communities to protect and improve the health of all people. In Jamaica, public health challenges include high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which are linked to poor diet, physical inactivity, and lifestyle choices.</p>
              <p>NCDs are responsible for a large proportion of deaths and hospitalisations in Jamaica. Unlike infectious diseases, NCDs are not passed from person to person. They develop over time, often as a result of habits formed from childhood. This means that promoting healthy habits among young people is one of the most effective strategies for reducing NCDs in the future.</p>
              <p>Access to healthcare is not equal across Jamaica. Rural communities and lower-income populations may have limited access to doctors, nurses, and health facilities. This means some people only seek help when they are already seriously ill, making treatment harder and more expensive.</p>
              <p>Schools can play a powerful role in public health by promoting physical activity, teaching nutrition, providing clean water and sanitation, and creating environments where students feel safe and supported. When schools partner with health organisations, the impact on communities can be significant and long-lasting.</p>

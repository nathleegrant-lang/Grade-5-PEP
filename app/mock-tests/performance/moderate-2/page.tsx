                <p className="whitespace-pre-line text-slate-700">DEFORESTATION IN JAMAICA: A SCIENCE FAIR REPORT

Deforestation is one of the most serious environmental challenges facing Jamaica today. This report explains what causes it, what effects it has, and what our school community can do to help.

CAUSES
Two main causes of deforestation are clearing land for farming and logging for timber. When forests are cut to make way for crops or pasture, large areas of trees are permanently removed. Logging for building materials also removes trees faster than they can naturally regrow.

EFFECTS
First, deforestation reduces Jamaica's water security. Forests allow rainfall to soak into the ground slowly, feeding rivers and underground springs. Without forests, water runs off quickly, causing flooding in wet seasons and dry rivers in the dry season. Second, soil on hillsides becomes unstable when tree roots are removed. This leads to landslides that can destroy homes and farmland.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OUR SCHOOL
First, our school should organise an annual tree-planting day in partnership with community members. Each class could be responsible for planting and monitoring five trees per year. Second, students could create a campaign to raise awareness about deforestation, sharing facts through posters, assemblies, and social media.

If we act now, we can help protect Jamaica's forests for future generations.

              <p>Deforestation is the clearing or removal of forests. In Jamaica, forests are cut down for farming, logging, and to make way for roads and buildings. The country has lost a significant portion of its original forest cover over the past century, putting many plant and animal species at risk.</p>
              <p>Forests are essential to Jamaica's environment and people. They capture rainfall and allow it to soak into the ground, feeding rivers and underground water sources. They prevent soil erosion on hillsides and provide habitat for endemic species — plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.</p>
              <p>When forests are removed, rivers can dry up in the dry season and flood more severely during heavy rain. Landslides become more frequent in deforested hillside areas. The loss of trees also contributes to climate change because trees store carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.</p>
              <p>Reforestation — the planting of trees to replace those lost — is one important response. Government programmes, schools, and community groups in Jamaica have organised tree-planting campaigns. However, reforestation takes decades to restore the full value of a mature forest, so preventing further deforestation is equally important.</p>
